# Federated-Learning-based-Semantic-Segmentation
Enhanced Federated Learning based-Semantic-Segmentation for Lane and Object Detection in Autonomous Driving
Specifically, we developed a new federated learning (FL) framework called "hybrid UNet-ResNet34 architecture" that integrates secure deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Differential Privacy (DP) to address privacy and scalability challenges in decentralized learning.
